/**
 * Adapted from Dispatch
 * https://github.com/RBusarow/Dispatch/blob/main/dispatch-android-espresso/src/main/java/dispatch/android/espresso/IdlingDispatcher.kt
 *
 * [IdlingResource] helper for coroutines.  This class simply wraps a delegate [CoroutineDispatcher]
 * and keeps a running count of all coroutines it creates, decrementing the count when they complete.
 *
 * If a coroutine dispatches to another dispatcher, this dispatcher will remain non-idle until the
 * outer coroutine has completed, or until the coroutines reach an *inactive* `suspend` point.  In
 * other words, if the tracked coroutine is suspended because it's waiting on a blocking I/O
 * operation, then the dispatcher will not be idle.  If the tracked coroutine is suspended because
 * it's waiting on something like a timer or user input, then the dispatcher will transition to
 * idle.
